"""Early-termination demo: a batch whose samples stop at different times.

Every trajectory is a planar two-body orbit. Depending on how it is seeded, a
trajectory either falls below a collision radius or crosses an escape radius
at some point along the way -- and once it does, it stops changing. The
step kernel maintains a device-side live count of the samples still going;
a conditional (IF) graph node guards the whole step with that count, so once
every sample has terminated the remaining replays of the horizon do no work.
hawk traces the ONE kernel that does all of this (RK4 step, termination
test, live-count update); eagle runs it three ways on the GPU: the GUARDED
graph (the IF node skips a replay once the count is zero), the UNGUARDED
graph (the identical captured pair, never skipped -- the one-variable
control the guarded arm is measured against), and an EAGER loop (the same
kernel, the guard evaluated host-side before every two-step replay, kept for
agreement and for a measured host-sync count, AND as a genuine speed
comparison now that the conditional node's own cost is measured out: on a
Quadro P2000 the guarded graph beats this host-guarded eager loop by
roughly 1.3-1.65x at small-to-medium batch and ties it at very large batch,
where the kernel itself dominates; at the smallest batches (1, 32 samples)
the skip does not pay for itself at all -- the conditional node's fixed
cost exceeds a tiny kernel's, so the UNGUARDED graph is the fastest arm
there -- see the module's ``report`` for the measured numbers). A dead
sample inside a still-live batch still costs a full step (the kernel has no
compaction, only a per-sample select); the saving only starts once EVERY
sample is done, which is why the skip's payoff scales with how much of the
horizon is past the last termination. A CPU arm (``--host``) runs the
identical kernel through eagle's host execution structure, with the guard
evaluated eagerly (there is no graph capture on host), so the example needs
no GPU at all.

Run it with ``python examples/early_termination.py --host`` (CPU) or
``--device`` (GPU, guarded vs unguarded vs eager). ``--torch`` (device only)
also times the same RK4 two-body physics written in idiomatic torch --
eager, eager with a host check, and both as a replayed CUDA graph -- and
prints each arm's ratio against our guarded graph, plus an agreement check
against our final state and termination step (demo measurement, not a
benchmark). ``--sweep`` prints the guarded/unguarded/eager wall-per-step
table over a range of batch sizes and horizon lengths (a quick sweep, not
part of the test; add ``--torch`` for an optional torch column, dropped for
the largest batch to keep the sweep under ~3 minutes).

    ``age``/``age_next`` ping-pong an increment-while-alive counter
    (``age_next = age + alive``): once a sample's ``alive`` reaches 0, its age
    stops advancing, so the age plane read back at the end IS that sample's
    termination step -- there is no per-replay step-number parameter to read
    it from, because a captured graph replay cannot see a scalar that varies
    per replay (a ``Param`` freezes at capture time).

    ``n_active`` is a one-cell accumulator, seeded to the batch size by the
    caller and never re-zeroed: every launch subtracts exactly the number of
    samples that terminate on THIS step (``still - alive``, zero for a sample
    that stays alive or was already dead), so it decays monotonically to zero
    as the batch finishes. An ``Accum`` plane must be a float type (there is
    no integer atomic accumulate), so the caller views this float32 cell as
    uint32 to build the graph's skip guard -- exact for batches under 2**24
    samples, comfortably above anything this demo runs.

    A dead sample's own step is a mathematical no-op (``x_next = x``,
    ``alive_next = 0``, ``age_next = age``, the accumulator's contribution
    ``still - alive = 0 - 0 = 0``) -- this is WHY the unguarded graph arm
    (which never skips, so it re-runs this no-op every remaining step) still
    lands bit-for-bit on the same final state as the guarded one.
