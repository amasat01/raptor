"""Zero-copy interop demo: one hawk kernel fed from, and handed back into,
NumPy, CuPy and PyTorch arrays with no copy where the family's own
certification matrix (``raptor.conformance.interop``) says there is none.

The kernel itself is intentionally trivial (``y = k * x``, a per-sample
vector scale) -- this demo is about the POINTERS a crossing does or does not
copy, not the physics. The device arm feeds it a CUDA-resident torch tensor
(a zero-copy view into eagle, row ``T-IN-CUDA-ALIAS``), writes the result
straight into a second CUDA torch buffer through the same zero-copy view
(row ``T-OUT-CUDA-ALIAS``), and separately feeds it a CPU-resident torch
tensor, which the identical adapter uploads with an honest copy (row
``T-IN-CPU-COPY``) -- three lines, three measured pointers, three declared
rows, checked against each other so a mismatch fails loudly rather than
silently. The host arm runs the same kernel on CPU threads with plain numpy
in/out; no row in the matrix governs that crossing (numpy is eagle's own
host currency, the same way cupy is its own device currency), so this demo
makes no ALIAS/COPY claim about it.

``--device`` also runs a copy-cost demo: the same kernel through the alias
path above versus the copying round-trip a caller without this protocol
would naturally write (CPU tensor out, upload, launch, download, CPU tensor
back), timed at a size where the PCIe cost is easy to see.

Run it with ``python examples/zero_copy_interop.py --host`` (CPU, needs no
GPU or torch) or ``--device`` (GPU, needs torch).
