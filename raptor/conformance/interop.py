certified today (:data:`CERTIFIED`) vs. declared-but-not-yet-built
(:data:`ROADMAP`), and the row-level ``ROWS`` catalogue, declared here in
full ahead of the packages that write the matrix tests — so that
:func:`assert_rows_complete` has a real gap to catch instead of declared and
collected always landing together. Framework objects NEVER enter raptor —
pointers and callables are passed in duck-typed; this module itself imports
no framework, ever (``find_spec`` never imports).
