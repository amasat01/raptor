"""The early-termination example's host arm runs everywhere; the device arm
(the graph-vs-eager comparison the example is really about) runs wherever a
GPU and cupy are both present and skips cleanly otherwise.

The example needs eagle and hawk, neither a raptor dependency, so this row
skips cleanly when either is absent. It is marked ``cross_repo`` because it
exercises two sibling repositories: the portability leg, which installs
raptor alone, deselects the marker rather than counting a skip.
